# FINALTRIP
## A Unified Intelligent Travel Responsibility Platform for India

### Investor Report - Confidential

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Opportunity:**
• Every year, **1.1 billion journeys** happen on Indian Railways alone  
• **85% of travelers** report high anxiety and poor decision quality when planning trips  
• **Fragmented platforms** (IRCTC, Ixigo, RedBus, Uber) force users to juggle 4-7 apps for a single journey  
• **Safety remains unquantified** – no standard metric for route, station, or coach safety assessment  
• **Last-minute failures** (delays, missed connections, no seats) cost travelers billions in wasted money and emotional stress  

**Our Solution:**
• A unified, AI-powered **Travel Responsibility Platform** that owns the entire journey – not just the booking  
• **Multi-objective route optimization** using Pareto efficiency (not single "best route" illusion)  
• **Proprietary Safety Score** integrating crowd data, incident history, and real-time risk factors  
• **Personal Guide Service** (Phase 2) – human + AI hybrid ensuring end-to-end safety and comfort  
• **First-mover advantage** in creating a "Travel Responsibility" category (vs. existing transactional booking apps)  

**The Ask:**
• **INR 2.5 Crore** seed funding for 18 months  
• **Target**: 100,000 users, production backend, mobile apps, IRCTC integration  
• **Path to Revenue**: Affiliate commissions → Freemium subscriptions → High-margin Personal Guide service

## 1. THE PROBLEM: Why Current Systems FAIL

### 1.1 Fragmentation Chaos

**Current Reality:**
• Users must open **IRCTC** (trains), **RedBus** (buses), **Ixigo/MakeMyTrip** (aggregators), **Google Maps** (routing), **Uber/Ola** (last-mile), **WhatsApp/SMS** (updates)  
• **No unified decision engine** – each platform optimizes for its own profit (hotels, flights, cabs), not user benefit  
• **Zero integration** – a delay on Train A affecting Connection B is invisible to the system  
• **No responsible entity** – if you miss a connection, multiple apps blame you; no one owns the problem  

**Real Example - Meet Priya:**
• Priya (28F) books a 2-connection train journey from **Chennai (MAS) to Bangalore (SBC)** using IRCTC  
• Train A departs on time but arrives 2 hours late at the intermediate transfer station (Kacheguda - KJD)  
• Priya's Connection B train departs at scheduled time; she misses it  
• IRCTC says "Train was delayed, not our fault"  
• No one offers a safe reroute at 11 PM from an unfamiliar station  
• She takes an unverified cab (safety risk), pays 3X the original ticket cost, and arrives exhausted  
• **Total impact**: ₹2,500 extra, 4 hours delay, high stress, personal safety risk  

### 1.2 Optimization Lie: "Fastest" and "Cheapest" Are Not Optimal

**Current Approach (Single-Objective):**
• Ixigo shows: "Fastest train: 8 hours, ₹1,200"  
• IRCTC shows: "Cheapest ticket: 12 hours, ₹400"  
• But users say: "I want fast AND cheap AND safe AND few transfers AND not at night"  

**The Problem:**
• No system considers **trade-offs realistically**  
• A "cheap" 12-hour journey has **3 transfers at night**, **high overcrowding**, **low seat confirmation probability (25%)**  
• An "fastest" 8-hour journey is **₹800 more expensive** and **leaves at 2 AM**  
• **Users are forced to choose blind**, sacrificing something important without realizing it  

**FINALTrip's Approach (Multi-Objective):**
• Present **Pareto-optimal routes** – routes where you **cannot get better** on one factor without sacrificing another  
• User chooses what matters: fastest? cheapest? safest? balanced?  
• Every option shown is genuinely superior for its trade-off profile

KEY INSIGHT:
• Without FINALTrip, users see only "Fastest" or "Cheapest"
• FINALTrip reveals ROUTE 03 – balanced, safe, reasonable price
• Users consciously choose trade-offs instead of being manipulated
```

### 1.3 Safety Crisis: The Invisible Killer

**Current Blind Spots:**
• **No safety score** exists for any route, station, or coach in India  
• Women travelers avoid certain trains due to:
  - Late-night transfers at poorly lit stations (Allahabad Jn, Bina, Gwalior)
  - Known overcrowding on specific coaches
  - Long waits between connections in isolated platforms
  - Lack of women-only waiting areas at interchange stations
• Yet apps show ZERO of this information  
• Families choose "fastest" without knowing they'll transfer at midnight  
• Solo travelers make unsafe decisions **out of ignorance**, not choice  

**Statistic:**
• **47% of women** modify or cancel journeys due to safety concerns (not shown by booking apps)  
• **₹500-2,000 extra cost** paid on average for "safer" alternatives found manually  
• **3-4 hours additional delay** while researching safer routes on forums/WhatsApp  

### 1.4 Emergency Vacuum: Who Is Responsible?

**During a Crisis (Breakdown, Missed Connection, Medical Emergency):**
• IRCTC: "Contact station master"  
• Ixigo: "This is not our service, contact the train operator"  
• Railway helpline: "Busy, call back later"  
• No one calls an ambulance  
• No one contacts your family  
• No one re-books you on an alternative train  
• **You are alone**  

**Result:**
• Panic, unsafe decisions, medical emergencies go untreated  
• Estimated **₹10,000 crore annual loss** due to failed journeys in India

## 3. THE SOLUTION: FINALTrip Architecture

### 3.1 Core Technology: Multi-Objective Optimization Engine

**What Makes This Different:**

| Feature | Current Apps (IRCTC, Ixigo) | FINALTrip |
|---------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Route Selection** | Single best option (fastest OR cheapest) | Pareto-optimal frontier (multiple genuinely superior options) |
| **Optimization Factors** | 2 (time, cost) | 10+ (time, cost, transfers, seat probability, crowding, safety, delay risk, late-night penalty) |
| **Safety Consideration** | None | Proprietary Safety Score (real data-driven) |
| **Dynamic Rerouting** | Manual rebooking or app-switching | Automatic, real-time, with alternative suggestions |
| **Responsibility** | Ends at booking | Extends until safe arrival at destination |
| **Emergency Support** | Helpline (busy, non-responsive) | Integrated ambulance, police, guide contact |
| **User Control** | Choose what app forces on you | Explicitly control trade-off priorities |

**The Engine:**
• Consumes **real-time data**:
  - IRCTC live seat availability & Tatkal probability
  - Historical delay patterns (past 2 years)
  - Station crowding data (from IoT sensors, mobile crowd intel)
  - Safety incident reports (police, railway, user feedback)
  - Weather impacts on delays
  - Last-mile transport availability (Uber, local cabs)

• Computes **Pareto frontier** in <2 seconds  
• Returns **5-8 genuinely distinct options** with transparent trade-off visualization  
• Ranks by user priority (safety-first, cost-conscious, time-optimized, balanced)  

### 3.2 Safety Score System: The USP

**How It Works:**

Each route, station, and coach gets a **Safety Score (0-100)** based on:

**Data Layer 1: Station & Infrastructure**
• Lighting quality (camera coverage, user reports)  
• Crowd density distribution (passenger count vs. platform capacity)  
• Police presence (stations with constables, emergency response time)  
• Accessibility (distance to waiting rooms, women-only areas, escalators for elderly)  
• Incident density (crimes, lost/found complaints, medical emergencies in past 12 months)  

**Data Layer 2: Coach & Time-of-Day**
• Coach type (AC-2-tier safer than unreserved general coaches)  
• Historical overcrowding (IoT sensors, mobile Wi-Fi density)  
• Gender composition (coaches with 30%+ women travelers rate safer in user feedback)  
• Reservation rate (confirmed seats safer than waiting list)  
• Time-of-day penalty (late-night transfers = -15 points, early morning = +5 points)  

**Data Layer 3: Real-Time Monitoring**
• Train delay status (delays increase connection risk)  
• Current passenger density (IoT + mobile data)  
• Weather hazards (disruptions increase uncertainty risk)  
• Police alerts (reported incidents on specific routes)  

**Formula (Simplified):**
```
Safety Score = (Infrastructure + Coach + Time-of-Day + Current Risk) / 4
              × Confidence Index (1.0 if >100k travelers on route, 0.7 if <10k)
```

**Output:**
• **Green (80-100)**: Very safe; recommended for solo travelers and families  
• **Yellow (50-79)**: Moderate risk; requires alertness; guide recommended for solo travelers  
• **Red (<50)**: High risk; not recommended without guide assistance  

**Example - Chennai Central Station:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STATION SAFETY PROFILE: Chennai Central (MAS)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure Safety           → 82/100                 │
│   • Well-lit platforms, CCTV coverage                   │
│   • 24/7 police presence                                │
│   • Women-only waiting area & coach booking             │
│                                                         │
│ Crowding at Peak Hours          → 65/100                │
│   • 4 PM - 8 PM: Very crowded (high risk time)         │
│   • 10 PM - 6 AM: Sparse, well-monitored               │
│                                                         │
│ Historical Safety Record         → 90/100                │
│   • Low crime incidents (0.2 per 100k travelers)       │
│   • Medical response time: 3 minutes avg                │
│                                                         │
│ ├─ NIGHT TRANSFER (10 PM - 6 AM) → Safety: 88/100      │
│ ├─ AFTERNOON (3 PM - 6 PM)       → Safety: 72/100      │
│ └─ MORNING (6 AM - 10 AM)        → Safety: 92/100      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.3 Real-Time Decision Support & Rerouting

**The Problem It Solves:**

Your train is 2 hours late. Connection train departs in 1 hour. What do you do?

**Current System:**
• Check IRCTC: "Train A is delayed" (status stale, updated every 15 min)  
• Open Ixigo: Shows new trains, but costs ₹300+ more  
• WhatsApp travel group: "Try this train!" (unverified)  
• Panic. Make a bad decision.  

**FINALTrip System:**
• **Automatic detection**: Train A's delay predicted 3 hours ago (based on historical patterns + current speed)  
• **Proactive alert**: "Your connection at risk. Reviewing alternatives. 4 better options found."  
• **Smart suggestions**:
  1. Same destination, same day, depart now, Cost +₹250, Route Safety: 85%, Seat Prob: 92%  
  2. Intermediate station detour, arrive 1.5 hrs later, Cost -₹100, Route Safety: 90%, Seat Prob: 78%  
  3. Next day premium express, Cost +₹1,200, Route Safety: 98%, Seat Prob: 100%  
  4. Multi-modal (bus + train combo), Cost -₹300, Route Safety: 75%, Seat Prob: 100%  
• **Human guide** (if subscribed) calls: "Hi Priya, I've booked you on Option 1. I'm arranging station-to-station assistance. You're safe."  
• **One decision, informed and supported**  

### 3.4 Personal Guide Service (Phase 2) – The Real Value

## 4. PRACTICAL REAL-WORLD SCENARIO

### The Case: Solo Woman, Overnight Journey, Chennai → Hyderabad

**Traveler: Anjali (26, Software Engineer)**
• Solo traveler, evening departure, overnight journey, arrives morning  
• Safety-conscious (primary concern), budget-aware (secondary)  
• First time to Hyderabad, unfamiliar with trains  

#### CURRENT SYSTEM (IRCTC + Ixigo):

**Step 1: Booking (30 minutes of confusion)**
```
IRCTC:  Shows 15 trains ranked by fare
        → Cheapest: ₹450, unreserved (general coach, very risky for solo woman at night)
        → "Fastest": ₹1,200, AC 2-tier, midnight departure
        No safety information whatsoever

Ixigo:  Same trains, slightly better UI
        "Popular choice" = cheapest, not best
        
Result: Anjali books ₹850 train, 3-tier AC, midnight departure (compromising safety for price)
        Gut feeling: unsafe but affordable
```

**Step 2: Journey (Nightmare)**
```
10 PM:  Train departs on time
2 AM:   Train hits unscheduled stop (signaling issue)
2:30 AM: Still stopped; no updates on expected departure
        WhatsApp groups say "might be 2 more hours"
        
3:00 AM: Train finally moves, but now 1.5 hours late
        Anjali's connection train at Hyderabad departs at 6 AM
        New ETA: 5:45 AM (11-minute buffer, risky)
        
4:30 AM: Another delay (track maintenance)
        ETA now 6:15 AM (MISSED CONNECTION)
        
6:15 AM: Arrives at Hyderabad Junction
        No pre-booked onward transport
        Unfamiliar city, exhausted, alone
        Takes unvetted Uber (safety risk)
        Spends ₹600 extra on premium ride ($-wise)
        
8:00 AM: Finally reaches destination, 2 hours late, drained, unsafe experience

TOTAL IMPACT: ₹1,450 (original + extra), 2-hour delay, safety compromise, stress
SATISFACTION: 2/10 (regrets booking, won't recommend)
```

#### FINALTRIP SYSTEM:

**Step 1: Booking (5 minutes, fully informed)**
```
FINALTrip App Opens:
Input: Chennai (MAS) → Hyderabad (HYD), Tomorrow evening, Solo woman, priority = SAFETY

Engine analyzes 100+ route combinations:

✓ SAFE EXPRESS selected (highlighted in green)
✓ Clear reasoning: "Best for solo women, no overnight transfers, women-only coach"
✓ Anjali sees safety metrics clearly vs. cost trade-off
✓ Booking: 1 tap
✓ Auto-selected "Personal Guide" (recommended for solo female travelers)
```

**Step 2: Journey (Proactive, Safe, Supported)**
```
6:00 PM:    Train departs
            FINALTrip sends: "Trip started. Guide is monitoring. You're safe."
            
1:30 AM:    Real-time system detects signaling delay (via live train GPS + IoT)
            Immediate prediction: "Train will be 50 minutes late, but connection safe"
            FINALTrip sends proactive alert: "Minor delay expected but manageable. Relax."
            (This prevents panic unlike IRCTC's silent 15-min updates)
            
4:00 AM:    Guide calls (not intrusive, brief): 
            "Anjali, slight delay but you'll make connection. I've pre-alerted the connecting train staff. You're on their radar."
            
5:45 AM:    Train arrives (15 min late)
            BUT: Staff was pre-notified by guide
            Immediate assistance: "Ms. Anjali? This way, connecting train waits 5 extra minutes for you."
            Porter assigned (by FINALTrip's partner network)
            Luggage transferred, Anjali guided to next platform
            
6:15 AM:    Makes connecting train comfortably
            FINALTrip: "Connection made! Relax. Final leg 2 hours to destination."
            
8:15 AM:    Arrives in Hyderabad safely
            Guide waiting at station: "Welcome! Car is outside, I'll accompany you to hotel."
            
8:45 AM:    Safe arrival confirmed
            FINALTrip: "Arrived safely! Family notified."
            
TOTAL IMPACT: ₹1,100 (all-in, guide included), 15-min delay (managed), safety = 94%, peace of mind = priceless
SATISFACTION: 9/10 (will book again, recommends to friends)
GUIDE INCENTIVE: ₹400 (60% margin, motivates excellence)
```

**Key Insights from Scenario:**
1. **Informed decision**: Anjali chose safety deliberately, not by luck  
2. **Proactive support**: Issues detected before they become crises  
3. **Human touch**: Guide removes uncertainty, adds confidence  
4. **Safety premium justified**: Extra ₹250 for peace of mind is worth it  
5. **Scalable model**: Guide gets ₹400/journey (₹10-12k/month if 25-30 journeys), motivated to deliver

## 5. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE & NOVELTY

### 5.1 vs. Current Apps (IRCTC, Ixigo, RedBus)

| Dimension | IRCTC | Ixigo/MM | FINALTrip |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Route Selection** | Single best (by gov algorithm) | Fastest + cheapest only | Pareto-optimal frontier (user chooses) |
| **Safety Metric** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✓ Real-time Safety Score (proprietary) |
| **Multi-Modal** | ❌ Trains only | ✓ Trains + flights (aggregator) | ✓ Trains + buses + flights + cabs (unified engine) |
| **Dynamic Rerouting** | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual | ✓ Automatic + guide assistance |
| **Emergency Support** | ❌ Helpline (slow) | ❌ None | ✓ Integrated ambulance + police + guide |
| **Personal Assistance** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✓ Human guide (premium service) |
| **Responsibility Model** | Booking only | Booking only | **End-to-end journey ownership** |
| **Women-Centric** | ❌ Generic | ❌ Generic | ✓ Safety scores, women guides, women-only features |
| **Decision Support** | ❌ You figure it out | ❌ You figure it out | ✓ AI + human explains trade-offs |

### 5.2 Why Competitors Can't Copy This Fast

**IRCTC (Government):**
• Moves slowly (bureaucracy, approvals)  
• No incentive to improve UX (monopoly on booking infrastructure)  
• Would take 3-5 years to build similar system  
• Cannot implement safety scoring (political sensitivity)  

**Ixigo/MakeMyTrip (Aggregators):**
• Business model depends on **transactional commissions**, not user well-being  
• Adding safety features = fewer bookings (users choose safer, cheaper routes) = lower revenue  
• Incentive misaligned with user benefit  
• Cannot afford to build proprietary Personal Guide service (high cost, low margin)  

**RedBus (Bus Specialist):**
• Single-modal expertise  
• No train integration capability  
• Safety scoring irrelevant for short-haul buses  

**Uber/Ola (Mobility Players):**
• Focus on last-mile, not route planning  
• No train/rail expertise  
• Could enter but not for 3-5 years  

**FINALTrip's Moat:**
1. **Data moat**: Every journey = safety data point. After 1M journeys, safety model is 10X better than entrants.  
2. **Network moat**: Guide ecosystem takes 2-3 years to build at scale (1,000+ trained guides).  
3. **User moat**: Once users experience "responsible travel", switching cost is high (safety expectations set).  
4. **Behavioral moat**: Platform becomes the trusted advisor, not a transaction engine.

## 6. TECHNOLOGY & ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1 Core Systems

**Real-Time Data Pipeline:**
• IRCTC API (live seat availability, status)

## 7. FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS & UNIT ECONOMICS

### 7.1 Revenue Model

**Affiliate Commissions (Phase 1):**
• 2-3% of booking value from IRCTC, flight partners  
• Conservative estimate: 50,000 users × 4 bookings/year × ₹1,000 avg × 2.5% = **₹1 crore/year**  

**Freemium Subscription (Phase 2):**
• 15% users convert to paid (premium features)  
• ₹99-199/month for real-time alerts, multi-modal routing, saved preferences  
• 50,000 users × 15% × ₹150/month × 12 = **₹1.35 crore/year**  

**Personal Guide Service (Phase 2-3):**
• 10% of journeys use guide (high-value segment)  
• Average revenue per guide journey: ₹400-600 (user) + ₹100-200 (B2B corporate) = ₹500-800  
• 50,000 users × 4 journeys/year × 10% × ₹600 = **₹1.2 crore/year** (Year 2)  
• Scaling: 500,000 users × 4 journeys × 10% × ₹600 = **₹12 crore/year** (Year 5)  

**B2B Data Insights:**
• Anonymized journey data → insights for railways, urban planners, logistics  
• 5-10 enterprise customers × ₹20-50 lakh/year = **₹50-100 lakh/year** (Year 3+)  

### 7.2 Unit Economics (Personal Guide Service - Highest Margin)

```
PER JOURNEY ECONOMICS:
─────────────────────────
User pays (guide service)              ₹600
├─ Guide commission                    ₹350 (58%)
├─ Platform cost (server, ops)         ₹50  (8%)
├─ Payment gateway (2%)                ₹12  (2%)
└─ MARGIN                              ₹188 (31%)

But if B2B corporate books:
─────────────────────────
Corporate pays (premium rates)         ₹800
├─ Guide commission                    ₹380 (47%)
├─ Platform cost                       ₹50  (6%)
├─ Payment gateway                     ₹16  (2%)
└─ MARGIN                              ₹354 (44%)

SCALE ECONOMICS:
─────────────────
At 1,000 journeys/day:
• 700 personal, 300 corporate
• Daily revenue: (700 × ₹600) + (300 × ₹800) = ₹6.6 lakh
• Daily margin (profit): (700 × ₹188) + (300 × ₹354) = ₹1.78 lakh
• Monthly: ₹53.4 lakh revenue, ₹16.5 lakh profit
• Annual: ₹6.4 crore revenue, ₹2 crore profit (from guide service alone)

GUIDE UTILIZATION:
─────────────────
1 guide handles 4-5 journeys/day
Cost per guide: ₹15-20k/month + ₹100/journey
Annual cost per guide: ₹2.4 lakh + commission
Revenue per guide: ₹350 × 4 journeys × 25 days = ₹3.5 lakh/month = ₹42 lakh/year
(Guide earns ₹25-30k/month, sustainable)

Guides needed for 1,000 journeys/day: 1,000 ÷ 4.5 = ~220 guides
Annual payroll: 220 × ₹5 lakh = ₹1.1 crore
Annual margin from guides: ₹2 crore - ₹1.1 crore = ₹90 lakh (sustainable, 14% margin)
```

## 9. RISK MITIGATION

### Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: IRCTC API Access / Government Regulation**
• *Impact*: Cannot get real-time data  
• *Mitigation*:
  - Begin engagement with IRCTC NOW (1 founder + advisor)  
  - Apply for official API access (formal process)  
  - Alternative: Web scraping + mobile app data (interim)  
  - Regulatory lobbying (show social benefit of safety scoring)  

**Risk 2: Personal Guide Service Cost Unsustainable**
• *Impact*: Can't recruit 200+ guides in timeframe  
• *Mitigation*:
  - Start with remote guides (SMS/call-based, no travel)  
  - Partner with existing travel agencies for guide network  
  - Flexible gig model (guides work part-time)  
  - Geographic phasing (start with metros, scale slowly)  

**Risk 3: Safety Scoring Lawsuits (if wrong classification)**
• *Impact*: Legal liability if recommended route has incident  
• *Mitigation*:
  - Transparent methodology (publish how scores calculated)  
  - Insurance (cyber liability + professional indemnity)  
  - Disclaimer: "Scores are estimates; user responsibility for final decision"  
  - Third-party audit (partner with safety research org)  

**Risk 4: Competition from Ixigo / IRCTC Copying**
• *Impact*: Features replicated, market share erosion  
• *Mitigation*:
  - Build data moat (1M journeys = 10X better safety model)  
  - Brand moat (trust in "responsible travel" positioning)  
  - Speed (capture market fast before competitors move)  
  - Guide network (high switching cost once established)  

**Risk 5: User Adoption in Tier-2 / Rural Markets**
• *Impact*: Limited to metros, can't scale to 250M users  
• *Mitigation*:
  - SMS-based interface (for non-smartphone users)  
  - Offline mode (pre-compute routes, no live data needed)  
  - Partner with local travel agents (white-label integration)  
  - Vernacular language support (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.)

│ 1600 ─ ★ (FASTEST: ROUTE01 - ₹545, 9.9 hrs)
│        │ 
│        │  Best for: Business travelers, time-critical
│        │
│ 1200 ─ │
│        │
│  900 ─ │  ✓ (BALANCED: ROUTE03 - ₹545, 10h)
│        │  ✓ (CHEAP2: ROUTE04 - ₹544, 17.6h, 2-transfers)
│        │
│  600 ─ ★ (CHEAPEST: ROUTE02 - ₹533, 10.9 hrs)
│        │
│        │ Best for: Budget-conscious, don't mind extra time
│        │
└────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────
           8         10        12        14        16        18
                        Time (Hours)

Pareto Routes (5 selected from 111 evaluated):
─────────────────────────────────────────────
• ROUTE01 (FASTEST): Cannot find faster at same cost
• ROUTE02 (CHEAPEST): Cannot find cheaper at same speed
• ROUTE03 (BALANCED): Sweet spot – 10h at ₹545
• ROUTE04 (CHEAP2): 2-transfers, ₹11 cheaper, 6.7 hours slower
• ROUTE05 (CHEAP3): 3-transfers, same cost, optimized for multi-modal

106 non-Pareto routes filtered out (dominated by above 5):
- "Slow & expensive" (12 hrs, ₹1,200)
- "Fast but too pricey" (8 hrs, ₹2,500)
- "Neither cheap nor fast" (14 hrs, ₹900)

USER CHOICE POWER:
If user chooses: "Fast + Safe (no night transfers)" → ROUTE01
If user chooses: "Cheapest overall" → ROUTE02
If user chooses: "Balanced (moderate comfort)" → ROUTE03
If user chooses: "Budget with one transfer" → ROUTE04
If user chooses: "Budget with flexibility on time" → ROUTE05

OUTCOME: User makes INFORMED trade-off choice, not a random selection.
